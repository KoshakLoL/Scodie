# Scodie
_Python File Manager, made with simplicity and speed in mind!_

Usage:
--------
```
>s # Show files of the current directory
>c [name] # Create file or directory
>o [name/number/path] # Open file (can execute .py!)
>d [name/number/path] [-f] # Delete file (-f = force)
>i [name/number/path] # Info about a file
>e [name] # Edit text file
>cd [directory] # Change Directory
>cp [name/number/path] [name/number/path] # Copy file

### "path" stands for ABSOLUTE path

### You can also open multiple files with ";"
### ex: c test_file1.txt;test_file2.txt;test_file3.txt

### NOTE! You can move/copy multiple files, but path
### should stay the same with each file!
```
